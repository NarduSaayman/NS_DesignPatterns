## What does **Best Practices** give us

Confidence in what you have built and comfort in familiarity of standardization with SOLID and Design Patterns. Unit Tests ensure correct logical implementation. <br> Keeping code from rotting. Make it durable and maintainable. For our own sanity and keeping a clear mind.

## Principles vs Patterns

### Design Principle

- Can be thought of as rules.
- Core absttract principles.
- Follow the **Principle** while designing the software.
- Abstract rather than concrete.
- Can be applied to any platform.

### Design Patterns

- Problems that have been solved, instead of reinventing the solution to the problem, apply a pattern.
- Well-proven, and tested by others.

***

## SOLID Principles

- A way of thinking.
- A mindset of mindulness.
- A foundation of quality.

    - S - Single Respnsibility
        - A class, method or piece of code need to do one thing and one thing well.
        - A logical and good separation of concern.
            - *The BadBook class example from Saurahb's example:*
                - seperatng the printing from the class and rather create a printer class.
        - Look for the business rules.
        - Find its domain, and build out.   

        <br>
    - O - Open/Closed Principle
        - A class should be open to extension but closed to modification.
            - *The Guitar example:*
                - Adding a flame style to it, you dont really want to modify the original.
        - Rather implement operations that can be overiden.

        <br>    
    - L - Liskov Substitution
        - A class **S** is a subtype of class **T**.
        - Objects of type **T** should be replacable with objects of type **S**.
        - Though desirable functionality shouldn't be lost.
        - Base inputs and outputs should be the same.

        <br>
    - I - Interface Segregation
        - It's better to have many Smaller interfaces, than a few Large interfaces.
        - Seperate the Interfaces functionality.
        - Dont implement interfaces that you wont be using.
        - Only create Abstract classes when you need them.

        <br>
    - D - Dependency Inversion
        - High level modules should not depend on low level modules, both should depend on abstraction.
        - Details depend on abstraction. Abstraction should not depend on details.
            - Loosley coppled
        
        <br>

## How do you find the **balance** with the SOLID Principle

- Can you satisfy all SOLID Principles 100%?
- What guides you towards the right balance?
    - Design Patterns
    - Architecture Patterns

    <br>

## Other Principles that fit nicely with SOLID Principles

- OOP
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritence
    - Polymorphism
    
 - Don't repeat yourself! - Don't copy paste code!

 # **Design Patterns FEB 15... continued FEB 16**

 ## What are design patterns?
 - Typical solution to commonly occuring problems in software design.
 - Not an Algorithm
 - Pre-made Blueprints
    - you can see the result
    - you see the features
    - exact order of implementation is up to you

## Gang of Four

![In a Nutshell](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/GOF.jpeg)

# [What are Creational Design Patterns?](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns)

![Creational Design Patterns](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/CreationalPatterns.png)

## [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

- Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

    - Example: Blacksmith - Orc or Elvish Blacksmith

## [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

- Allows you to produce families of related pbjects without specifying their concrete classes

    - Example: Creating a Kingdom - Orcish and Elvish have different themes, though they all have a King, Castle, and Army

## [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

- Allows you to construct complex objects step by step. The Pattern allows you to produce different types of representations of an object using the same construction code.

- A director is required to check if the buidler is following the instructions properly.

    - Example: Character Generated RPG - Allows the definition of specific things of the Character without bloating a constructors parameters.

## [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

- Allows you to ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- Provide a global access point to that instance.

    - Example: Ivory Tower of the Wizards - There can only be 1 Ivory tower. It can be used when it's required.

# [What are Structural Design Patterns?](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns)

![Structural Paterns](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/StructuralPatterns.png)

## [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

- Structural deign pattern that allows objects with imcompatible interfaces to collaborate.

    - Example: Celphone Charger Adapters - Youll carray adapter to be able to interact wiht foreign sockets.
    - Example: kph and mph - An adapter to convert from kph to mph or mph to kph.
    
## [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

- Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

    - Example: Decorating a Chirstmas Tree

## [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)

- Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complexset of classes.

    - Example: Things happening in a Car Engine:
        - Separating parts of the engine into other objects, yet only needing to interact with the engine.
        - Running startEngine(), all other operations of other objects start their processes.

## [Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy)

- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

# [What are Behavoural Design Patterns?](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns)

![Behavioral Patterns](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/BehavioralPatterns.png)

## [Iterator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

- Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

    - Allows for looping through structures that have the logic to do so.

## [Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)

- Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
    - Web knows/should know this one too well.

## [Model View-Controller (MVC)]()

- Model
    - Manage Data.
- View
    - Display the Data.
- Controller
    - Mediate updating the data.
    - Redrawing the display.

## [Service-Layer]()

![Service Layer](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/servicelayer.jpeg)

- Abstraction over domain logic
- Defines application's boundary
    - Layer of services
    - Each Service 
        - Set available operations
        - Response to each operation.

![Contorllers & Data Store](./FEB_15_SOLID_&_DP/controller&datastore.jpeg)

## [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)

- Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from, when connecting to a remote service or resource. This can improve the stability and resiliency of an application.
